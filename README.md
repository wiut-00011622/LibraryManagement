# Library Management System

This repository is the digital backbone of a next-generation library management system, whichâ€”by harnessing the power of ASP.NET Coreâ€”turns the page on traditional library logistics.

## Features

- **MVC Front-End**: A sleek interface for seamless library management.
- **Microservice API**: Robust and responsive API for bookish CRUD operations.
- **Entity Framework Core**: The ORM that librarians have only dreamt of until now.
- **Swagger**: Because even APIs need documentation that reads like a bestseller.

## Quick Start

Here's how to get your system up and running faster than you can say 'Dewey Decimal':

```bash
# Clone this repository like it's a rare first edition
git clone https://github.com/wiut-00011622/LibraryManagement.git

# Navigate into the project directory like you're exploring the library stacks
cd LibraryManagement

# Install dependencies like you're stocking the shelves with classic novels
dotnet restore

# Run the application like you're checking out books on a Friday afternoon
dotnet run
```
## How to Use

To use this system, simply follow the MVC yellow brick road, and you'll find yourself in the Emerald City of library management.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions like a librarian welcomes readers. Submit a pull request, and we'll get to it faster than a librarian says 'Shh!'

## Acknowledgements

- Hats off to the open-source community for making collaboration possible.
- Kudos to anyone who's ever returned a library book on time.

## A Final Word of Caution

Deploying on AWS has been a journey of discovery, especially when discovering the size of the bill. It's like leaving a library with a book you forgot to check out - thrilling until you get the fine!

## Special Thanks

Big shoutout to our tireless instructor, who bravely delves into student code, finding bugs where we saw features, and helping us turn coffee into code. Without your guidance, we'd probably just be expert Netflix navigators by now. Here's to many more semicolons, fewer syntax errors, and the occasional reminder to actually read the error messages. ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»
